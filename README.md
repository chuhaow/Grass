# Water Simulation

An attempt at modelled foliage rendering with GPU based frustum culling

## Description

This project is a attempt to rendered a grass field with modelled grass using GPU instancing. 

Some Features implemented are:
- Simulated Wind
- Grass age (Longer blades of grass are more yellowed)
- GPU based frustum culling

The GPU based frustum culling can be seen in the top right of the image below
